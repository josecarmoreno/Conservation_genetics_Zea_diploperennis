# Conservation genetics of <em>Zea diploperennis</em>

### Filtering
The first script "prefiltering_schemes.sh" is to eliminate multiallelic sites and to extract <em>Zea diploperennis</em> data, this script has the "metada_diploperennis.R" script embedded- Itt creates a study-wide dataset with all the samples from <em>Zea diploperennis</em> and two populations subsets, one with the genomic data of Jalisco samples and another with the Nayarit samples.

The script "dataset1_structure.sh" contains a filtring scheme for a study-wide data set. The resulting data set is intended for structure analysis and contains 130 individuals and 3,703 SNPs.
